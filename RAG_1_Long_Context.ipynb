        "# Long Context vs. RAG\n",
        "We will first explore an alternative to traditional RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation). Instead of chopping documents into small pieces (\"chunking\") and storing them in a database, we will leverage Gemini's Long Context Window.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**Why this matters:** Traditional RAG is like using a search engine to find a single page in a book. It’s fast but can miss context. Long Context is like asking an expert to read the entire book before answering.\n",
        "\n",
        "**The Advantage:** For \"small\" datasets (under ~1,000 pages), this method often yields higher accuracy because the model sees the entire document structure (tables, footnotes, and headers) intact.\n",
        "\n",
        "**The Technique:** We will use Prompt Engineering to force the model into an \"Auditor Mode,\" requiring it to cite specific sections for every claim it makes.\n",
        "\n",
        "**The Scenario:** You are building a compliance tool for New Horizon Solutions. You need to audit employee records against company policy (Benefits & FMLA) to ensure no rules were broken.\n"

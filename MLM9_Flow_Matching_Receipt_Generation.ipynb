        "This section defines the core components of our generative model: the `ConditionalUNet` architecture, which is a neural network designed for image generation tasks, and the `FlowMatching` class, which implements the training and sampling logic for flow-based generative models. It also includes our custom `ReceiptDataset` to handle loading and transforming the image data.\n",
        "\n",
        "### SinusoidalPositionEmbeddings\n",
        "This class creates sinusoidal positional embeddings for time steps. In generative models like Flow Matching, these embeddings help the network understand the 'progress' of the generation process (from noise to data) by providing a unique, continuous representation for each time step.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Block\n",
        "The `Block` class represents a fundamental building block of the U-Net architecture. It consists of convolutional layers, batch normalization, and ReLU activations. It also integrates time embeddings, allowing the model to condition its output on the current time step in the flow. The `transform` layer handles downsampling (Conv2d with stride 2) or upsampling (ConvTranspose2d) within the U-Net.\n",
        "\n",
        "### ConditionalUNet\n",
        "The `ConditionalUNet` is the main neural network architecture. It's a U-Net variant that processes images and is 'conditional' because it takes both the image, the current time step (`t`), and a class label (though here we only have one class) as input. This allows the model to learn to generate specific types of images. It consists of a series of `Block`s for downsampling (`downs`) and upsampling (`ups`), with skip connections (residuals) to preserve detail.\n",
        "\n",
        "### FlowMatching\n",
        "This class encapsulates the core logic of the Flow Matching generative process. Unlike diffusion models that iteratively add and remove noise, Flow Matching learns a continuous-time vector field that smoothly transports a simple prior distribution (e.g., Gaussian noise, `x_0`) to a complex target distribution (the real data, `x_1`).\n",
        "\n",
        "-   **`compute_loss`**: Calculates the loss for training. It samples `x_0` (noise), `x_1` (real data), and a random time `t`. It then computes an intermediate point `x_t` on the straight line path between `x_0` and `x_1`, and asks the model to predict the velocity vector (`v_target`) that points from `x_0` to `x_1`. The loss is the mean squared error between the model's predicted velocity (`v_pred`) and the true target velocity.\n",
        "-   **`sample`**: Implements an Euler ODE solver for generating new images. Starting from random noise (`x_0` at `t=0`), it iteratively updates the image by following the velocity field predicted by the trained `ConditionalUNet`. This process effectively traces a path from noise to a generated image (`x_1` at `t=1`).\n",
        "\n",
        "### ReceiptDataset\n",
        "This custom `torch.utils.data.Dataset` class is responsible for loading our receipt images. It reads image files from the specified directory, converts them to grayscale, resizes them to the model's input dimensions, and transforms them into PyTorch tensors. Since we are only generating receipts, it assigns a single class label (0) to all images."

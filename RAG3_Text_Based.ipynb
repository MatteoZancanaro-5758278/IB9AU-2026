This is because LLMs have a limited context window, and providing smaller, relevant chunks improves retrieval accuracy and reduces computational load.\n",

        "        *   **`chunk_overlap=50`**: This creates an overlap of 50 tokens between consecutive chunks. Overlap helps ensure that context isn't lost when a piece of information spans across two chunks. For example, if a sentence is at the very end of one chunk, the beginning of that sentence will also appear in the next chunk, providing continuity."

        "This notebook illustrates the process of how a bimodal distribution, when subjected to repeated additions of Gaussian noise, gradually transforms into a unimodal (single-peaked) distribution. This phenomenon is related to the Central Limit Theorem and the properties of convolution. Each iteration of adding noise effectively 'blurs' the distribution, eventually smoothing out the distinct peaks into a single, broader peak."
